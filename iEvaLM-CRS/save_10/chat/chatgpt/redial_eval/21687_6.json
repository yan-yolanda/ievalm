For instance, there's a classic film from 1953 that combines suspense and wit, featuring a charming lead who gets caught up in a web of intrigue. Then there's a 1999 film about a teacher who finds herself in a rather precarious situation with her students, filled with dark humor. Lastly, a more recent film from 2018 features a superhero with a sharp tongue and plenty of action, making it a hilarious ride. These films really capture the essence of action-comedy!",
