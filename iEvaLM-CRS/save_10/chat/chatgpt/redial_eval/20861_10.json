There are two action-packed movies featuring a unique blend of sci-fi and humor that I think you might enjoy. One of them involves time travel and has a great storyline about saving the world, while the other is a sequel that continues the adventures of agents dealing with extraterrestrial threats. Both films feature the same charismatic lead actor and are known for their entertaining action sequences and comedic moments. Would you like to know more about them?",
