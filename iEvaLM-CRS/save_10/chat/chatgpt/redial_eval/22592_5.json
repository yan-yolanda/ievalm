For instance, there's a film that masterfully combines both psychological tension and supernatural occurrences, set in a hauntingly atmospheric location. It explores themes of isolation and madness, featuring a family in a remote hotel. Another film I like has a similar eerie vibe, focusing on a mother and her children in a mysterious house, where the line between reality and the supernatural blurs. Both films are excellent examples of how fear can be portrayed in different ways.",
