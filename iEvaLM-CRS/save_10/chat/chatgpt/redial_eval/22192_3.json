For instance, there's a film that features a journalist navigating the vibrant and chaotic atmosphere of Puerto Rico in the 1960s, filled with quirky characters and a touch of surrealism. Another one is a hilarious tale about a group of friends who experience a wild night in Las Vegas, leading to unexpected and outrageous situations. Both films offer a mix of comedy and a glimpse into the characters' lives.",
