For instance, there's a classic film featuring a group of paranormal investigators who tackle supernatural entities in New York City. It's a blend of humor and adventure that has become iconic. Additionally, there's a hilarious movie that parodies horror films, filled with over-the-top comedy and memorable characters. Lastly, there's a buddy cop film that combines action and humor, showcasing the dynamic between two very different detectives. These films are definitely worth checking out!",
