For instance, there's a sequel that continues the story of a wisecracking anti-hero who breaks the fourth wall and delivers plenty of laughs while also featuring intense action sequences. The original film also has a similar vibe, introducing this character and his unconventional approach to heroism. Both films are known for their humor, over-the-top action, and memorable characters.",
