One is a comedy that explores the consequences of having a remote control that can manipulate time. Another is a superhero film that features a groundbreaking portrayal of a black hero and has a strong cultural impact. Lastly, there's a comedy about a man who becomes a hairdresser in a foreign country, which is quite entertaining. Let me know if you'd like to hear more about these!",
